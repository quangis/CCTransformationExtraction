# cct-question-parser

This program extracts [CCT](https://github.com/quangis/cct) 
transformations from geo-analytical questions in natural language.

## Installation

### Requirements

The program is implemented in python (version 3.7). Several libraries 
should be installed (use pip command to install the following libraries) 
before running the code:

pip install numpy allennlp
pip install -U spacy
pip install nltk
pip install word2number

## Usage

Run the script `Identify.py` on `GeoAnQu.txt` to get training results 
`Results_train_Auto.json`. Check the [Grammar/](Grammar/) folder for 
more details of the functional grammar in `GeoAnQu.g4`. Check the 
[Dictionary/](Dictionary/) folder for the concept dictionary.

To check the evaluation, navigate to 
[CCTrans_evaluation/](CCTrans_evaluation/) folder, and use `evalTest.py` 
to generate `EvaluationResults.csv`. `Results_test_Auto.json` is 
generated by running `Identify.py` on `corpus.txt`. 
`Results_test_Manual.json` is manually generated as the gold standard 
used in evaluation.
